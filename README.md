# HENNGE Challenge - Frontend Password Validation

This project is part of the HENNGE challenge focused on implementing a frontend password validation feature. It ensures that passwords meet specific security requirements before submission.

## Features

- **Password Validation**: Ensures the password meets the following criteria:
  - Minimum length: 8 characters
  - Contains at least one lowercase letter
  - Contains at least one uppercase letter
  - Contains at least one number
  - Contains at least one special character (e.g., `@`, `#`, `$`)
  
- **User-Friendly Feedback**: Provides real-time feedback to the user on password strength as they type.

## Installation

To get started with this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Santoshpatel112/-HENNGE.git
    ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd frontend_password_validation_v1_challenge/challenge/react
    ```

3. Install the necessary dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Run the project:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

The project should now be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## How It Works

The password validation feature is implemented in React. It uses a regular expression to check if the password meets the criteria and provides feedback for each rule.
